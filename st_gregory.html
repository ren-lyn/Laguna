      A Sanctuary of Faith and Heritage in Majayjay, Laguna

    Step into the heart of Majayjay, Laguna, and discover the awe-inspiring Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church—a living testament to centuries of faith, resilience, and architectural brilliance. Established in 1575, this historic church stands as one of the oldest Roman Catholic churches in the Philippines, having withstood fires, typhoons, and wars to remain a beacon of devotion and cultural heritage. 

    In 2025, the church was honored with the title of Minor Basilica by Pope Francis, marking it as the first in the Diocese of San Pablo and recognizing its significance as a center of worship and pilgrimage. 

    The church's Romanesque architecture is a marvel to behold, featuring a three-tiered façade adorned with intricate carvings and a towering belfry that offers panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. Inside, visitors are greeted by antique statues of saints, azulejo-tiled floors, and a series of retablos that showcase the rich artistic heritage of the region. 

    Adjacent to the church stands the expansive convent, one of the best-preserved examples in the country, offering a glimpse into the daily life of the clergy during the Spanish era. The convent houses a small museum displaying old parish documents and ecclesiastical silver, providing visitors with a deeper understanding of the church's storied past. 

    Whether you're a pilgrim seeking spiritual solace or a traveler eager to explore the rich tapestry of Philippine history, a visit to Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church promises an enriching experience that connects the past with the present.</p>
