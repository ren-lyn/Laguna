      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        The **Pyramids of Giza** are one of the most iconic and ancient wonders of the world, located on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt. Built around 4,500 years ago, these monumental structures have captivated travelers and archaeologists alike for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The complex is home to three main pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The Great Pyramid, built for Pharaoh Khufu, is the largest of the three and was originally 146 meters tall, though it now stands at 138 meters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The **Sphinx**, a giant limestone statue with the body of a lion and the head of a Pharaoh, also stands near the pyramids, adding to the mystique of this ancient site. The pyramids were originally constructed as tombs for the pharaohs and their queens, intended to ensure a safe journey to the afterlife.
