      Where the Story of a National Hero Begins

    Travel back in time and walk through the childhood home of the Philippines’ national hero, Dr. José Rizal, at the beautifully preserved Rizal Shrine in Calamba, Laguna. This historical landmark is a faithful replica of the original Spanish-era house where Rizal was born and raised—offering visitors a rare and inspiring glimpse into the early life of the man who ignited a revolution through his writings.

    Explore the traditional Bahay na Bato architecture, original family furnishings, and carefully curated artifacts that tell the story of Rizal’s family, education, and formative years. The museum grounds also feature a library, gallery, and Rizaliana exhibit, making it an enriching experience for students, history buffs, and tourists alike.

    Set in the heart of Calamba, the Rizal Shrine is not just a museum—it's a symbol of Filipino identity, pride, and the enduring legacy of one of the greatest minds in Philippine history.

    Visit the Rizal Shrine—where history lives, and heroes are remembered.</p>
