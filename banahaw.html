      A Journey of Nature, Spirituality, and Discovery Awaits

    Rising to over 2,100 meters, Mount Banahaw is the highest peak in the Calabarzon region and one of the Philippines’ most revered mountains. Located between the provinces of Laguna and Quezon, this active stratovolcano is more than just a hiking destination—it’s a sacred site, a biodiversity haven, and a place of deep spiritual significance.

    Often called a “Holy Mountain,” Mount Banahaw has long been a pilgrimage site for mystics, faith healers, and cultural devotees, who believe its slopes are blessed with healing energy. Along the trails, you’ll encounter natural springs, caves, rock formations, and sacred sites where rituals and prayers are still performed today.

    For trekkers, the mountain offers challenging climbs through mossy forests, steep ascents, and rewarding summit views of neighboring peaks and distant islands. It is part of the Mounts Banahaw–San Cristobal Protected Landscape, ensuring the conservation of its rich flora and fauna.

    Whether you're seeking spiritual renewal, ecological exploration, or mountain adventure, Mount Banahaw promises a profound and unforgettable experience.

    Climb with purpose—discover the soul of Mount Banahaw.</p>
