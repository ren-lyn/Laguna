      A Hidden Sanctuary of Faith and Revolution

      Venture into the heart of Laguna's rich history at the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery, the only one of its kind in the Philippines. Established in 1845 under the guidance of Franciscan priest Fr. Vicente Velloc, this unique cemetery was designed as a public burial site, with an underground crypt reserved for Spanish friars and prominent local families. 
      
      Beyond its architectural significance, the cemetery played a pivotal role during pivotal moments in Philippine history. During the Philippine Revolution, it served as a clandestine meeting place for revolutionary leaders, including Pedro Paterno and Gen. Severino Taiño, who planned the historic Pact of Biak-na-Bato in 1897. Its underground chambers also provided refuge for Filipino leaders during the Philippine–American War and for guerrillas resisting the Japanese occupation in World War II. 
      
      Today, the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery stands as a National Historical Landmark, preserving the legacy of faith, resistance, and resilience. Visitors can explore its Baroque-style architecture, descend into the solemn crypts, and reflect on the stories etched into its walls. A visit here offers a profound connection to the past and a deeper understanding of the nation's journey to independence.
      
      Experience the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery—a testament to the enduring spirit of the Filipino people.
