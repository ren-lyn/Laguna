      A Sanctuary of Faith and Heritage in Laguna

    Discover the rich history and architectural splendor of St. John the Baptist Parish Church in Liliw, Laguna—a living testament to the enduring faith and craftsmanship of the Filipino people. Established in 1605 by Franciscan missionaries, this Baroque-style church stands as a beacon of devotion and resilience. 


    The church's striking red-brick façade, crafted from adobe and clay bricks, exudes timeless elegance. Above the main entrance, a sculpted image of the Baptism of Jesus by St. John the Baptist welcomes visitors, while stained glass windows and red-bricked columns add to its architectural charm. 

    Inside, the church boasts three intricately designed retablos adorned with gold leaf, each housing statues of revered saints. The Capilla de San Buenaventura, a small chapel within the church, houses a first-class relic of St. Bonaventure and commemorates a miraculous event in 1664 when the image of San Buenaventura reportedly wept and sweated blood. 


    The church's patio, known as Patio de Sagrada Familia, features a white statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and elevated statues of various saints, reflecting the town's deep-rooted Christian teachings. 


    Whether you're a pilgrim seeking spiritual solace or a traveler captivated by history and architecture, St. John the Baptist Church in Liliw offers a profound experience that connects the past with the present. Visit and witness a sanctuary where faith, heritage, and artistry converge.</p>
